After you open the pointFive.cy.js file found in the e2e folder, you need to open the terminal and install cypress npm install cypress --save-dev

Then open the json and write this script:

{ "devDependencies": { 
   "cypress": "^13.6.3"
   },
"scripts": 
   { "cypress:open": "cypress open" 
   }
} 
And finally run it: npm run cypress:open
